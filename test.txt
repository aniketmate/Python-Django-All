init gets called when at the time object creation Automatically magic method
first argument reserved self
self points to current object holds object ref
u can define instance variables?  by using self keyword
u can use any alternate name instead of self BUT preferred self
instance  seperate copy for each object  
static variable class level variable 
local instance access, declare, modify, delete instance variable
class method access, declare, modify, delete static variable
if instance var defined same name as static -- takes init variable
declare inside class and outside method
access inside class and outside method but after declaring
in init, by using self if instance var defined same name as static takes init variable
outside the class,  by using classname
in init, access the static variable by using classname classname.static_variable_name
in instance method, using self 
in instance method, using classname classname.static_variable_name
outside the class, if we try to modify the static variable using object reference/reference variable
it wil create a new attribute for that object
 inside the class, if we try to modify the static variable using self
it wil create a new attribute for that object
in init, we can modify the static variable using classname classname.static_variable_name new_name
in instance method, we can modify the static variable using classname classname.static_variable_name new_name
